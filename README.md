# Web Dashboard for Doctors and Patients

## Project Abstract

This project aims to develop a secure web-based dashboard where patients can input and manage their medical data, and doctors can visualize this information clearly and interactively to support ongoing care and decision-making.

## Background and Motivation

In many healthcare systems today, there is a lack of seamless digital communication between patients and healthcare providers. Patients often store their medical information across scattered documents or apps, while doctors have limited access to consistent, longitudinal health data outside of appointments. This fragmentation makes it difficult to track trends, detect risks early, or personalize treatment plans.

This project proposes building a web-based dashboard where:

- **Patients** can log in to a private, secure account and upload or manually input health data (e.g., blood pressure, weight, glucose levels, symptoms, notes).
- **Doctors** can access a dashboard view of their assigned patients with time-series visualizations, anomaly alerts, and downloadable reports.

The platform will promote self-management for patients and provide doctors with better insights into patient progress between visits. Previous efforts in this space often lacked real interactivity, scalability, or privacy control. Our solution aims to cover all these aspects using modern web development practices and cloud-based infrastructure.
